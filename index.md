## 🧠 About Me  
I’m a **PhD candidate in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Toronto**, specializing in **Large Language Model (LLM) explainability and concept probing**.  
My work explores how LLMs represent abstract human concepts and how these internal mechanisms can be interpreted to make AI systems more transparent, reliable, and safe.  

I’ve co-authored research published in **ACL**, **EACL**, **JMIR**, and **IEEE**, and my current projects focus on **agentic workflows**, **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**, and **interpretable model behavior**.  
I’m passionate about **bridging scientific research and real-world AI systems** that align with human reasoning.
